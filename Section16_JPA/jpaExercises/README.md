## Description

Section16_JPA is a study exercise related to the ORM tool Hibernate (https://hibernate.org/).
Here, i made an effort to comprehend the best functionalities provided by the Hibernate package. 
The goal of the exercise was to connect with a MySql database and made a bunch of transactions, 
like create tables, insert data, update data, ...
For simplicity purposes, i didn't use build tool like Maven.
